   <para>the check_preflight hook is invoked immediately prior to every
   check being performed.  The actual invocation of the check can be
   avoided by returning NOIT_HOOK_DONE instead of NOIT_HOOK_CONTINUE.

   <para>The arguments to this function are the module of the check
   the check itself and the causal check (NULL if this check was not
   induced by the completion of another check), respectively.</para>
   <para>This instrumentation point can be used to audit intended check
   activity or prevent a check from running (such as an ACL).</para>

   <section><title>check_postflight</title>
   <para>The check_postflight hook is invoked immediately subsequent to
   a check being commenced.  Note that due to the asynchronous nature
   of Reconnoiter, it is highly unlikely that the check will have 
   completed by this time.</para>
   <para>The arguments to this function are the module of the check,
   the check itself and the causal check (NULL if this check was not
   induced by the completion of another check), respectively.</para>
   <para>Returning NOIT_HOOK_CONTINUE and NOIT_HOOK_DONE have the same
   effect for this instrumentation point.</para>
