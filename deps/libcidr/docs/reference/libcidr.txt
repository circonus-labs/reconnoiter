Summary

   libcidr is a library to make it easier to handle IP addresses and
   blocks, and manipulate them in various ways.

   The core of the library is a pair of functions that take a human
   readable string and turn it into our internal representation of a CIDR
   address block (cidr_from_str() ), and one to take that internal
   representation and turn it into a human-readable string (cidr_to_str()
   ). There are a large number of options for how to format that string,
   as well.

   Additionally, there are functions to compare different CIDR blocks, to
   determine if they're equal, or if one is contained within the other.
   This functionality can be useful for writing access-control code, or
   client-dependant configuration, or similar things. There are functions
   to manipulate address blocks and determine attributes of them, like
   network/broadcast addresses, the range of host addresses, the number
   of available host addresses, etc. There are functions to split a CIDR
   block into the two smaller blocks it contains, or to derive the parent
   block that it is itself contained within. And there are functions to
   translate to and from in_addr-type structures, which the operating
   system commonly uses to represent addresses for handle socket
   connections and so forth.

   In short, just about anything you might do in a program with IP
   addressing, whether referring to individual hosts, or to any sized
   subnets, libcidr is designed to simplify handling. It's not a DNS
   library, nor is it a socket abstraction layer. It's just a set of
   functions for manipulating raw IP addresses in various ways.

   The functions generally follow standard C conventions. They tend to
   return 0 or a pointer when acting properly, and -1 or NULL when
   something went wrong (unless the function usage suggests other
   returns, of course, as in cidr_get_pflen() ). They set errno when
   returning an error; the error codes each function can return are
   documented with the function.

   libcidr doesn't use any threading itself. It should, however, be safe
   to use in any threaded program if used sensibly. Only a very few
   functions use static strings, and those that do (cidr_version() and
   cidr_numaddr() and its related functions being the only ones I can
   think of) tend to be constant strings as well, so they wouldn't be
   changing. Of course, you don't want to cidr_free() a CIDR in one
   thread while you're still using it in another, but if you do, it's not
   libcidr's fault.

Data structures

     * CIDR: A single CIDR-format IP block
       This datatype is intended for internal use only
          + Note:
            Use the cidr_free() function to free the memory associated
            with this datatype, and the cidr_alloc() function to allocate
            and initialize the structure.
          + Members:
               o int version: The structure version. This is reserved for
                 future use, and put in to hold its place at the start of
                 the array.
               o uint8_t addr[16]: The 16 octets that make up an IP
                 address. For v6 addresses, all are used. For v4
                 addresses, only the last 4 are really used. The prior 2
                 octets are filled in with all-ones, so that the internal
                 representation matches the v4-compat IPv6 addressing
                 block. This is useful when, for instance, using
                 cidr_to_in6addr() , in that it gives you the expected
                 result.
               o uint8_t mask[16]: The 16 octets that make up an IP
                 netmask. For v4 addresses, only the last 4 are really
                 used; the rest are intialized to all-bits-one however,
                 which is correct in spirit.
               o int proto: The protocol the address described is.
                 Currently possible values are CIDR_IPV4 and CIDR_IPV6. I
                 think that's pretty self-explanatory.

            The returned structure should be cleaned up using cidr_free()
            .
          + Arguments:

     * cidr_alloc(): Create a CIDR
          + Summary:
            Allocate memory for a CIDR structure and initialize the
            necessary pieces.

     * cidr_contains(): Compare netblocks
          + Summary:
            This function is passed two CIDR structures describing a pair
            of netblocks. It then determines if the latter is wholly
            contained within the former.
            A common use-case of this will generally involve the second
            "block" actually being a host (/32 or /128) address, as when
            you're implementing ACL's. But that's really just a specific
            case of the second block being any other size; there's
            nothing special or magical about it. As far as libcidr is
            concerned, they're just two netblocks.
          + Arguments:
               o const CIDR * big: The netblock which may (or may not)
                 contain the second arg.
               o const CIDR * little: The netblock which may (or may not)
                 be contained within the first arg.
          + Returns:
            int
            Returns 0 if little is wholly contained within big. Returns
            -1 if it's not, or if an error occured.
          + Error codes:
               o

                    0
                            No error (little not in big)

               o

                    EFAULT
                            Passed NULL

               o

                    EINVAL
                            Invalid argument

               o

                    ENOENT
                            Internal error (shouldn't happen)

               o

                    EPROTO
                            Protocols don't match

     * cidr_dup(): Duplicate a netblock
          + Summary:
            Allocate a CIDR , and fill it in with a duplicate of the
            information given.
            The returned structure should be cleaned up using cidr_free()
            .
          + Arguments:
               o const CIDR * src: A CIDR structure to be copied.
          + Returns:
            CIDR *
            Returns a CIDR struct containing a copy of src. Returns NULL
            on failure.
          + Error codes:
               o Note:
                 cidr_dup() can fail and set errno for any of the reasons
                 listed for cidr_alloc() .
     * cidr_equals(): Compare two blocks for equality
          + Summary:
            This function is passed two CIDR structures describing a pair
            of netblocks. It checks to see if they happen to describe the
            same netblock.
          + Arguments:
               o const CIDR * one: One netblock.
               o const CIDR * two: Another netblock.
          + Returns:
            int
            Returns 0 if the two CIDR structs describe the same netblock.
            Returns -1 otherwise.
     * cidr_free(): Free a CIDR structure.
          + Summary:
            Takes a CIDR structure and free() 's all its component parts.
          + Arguments:
               o CIDR * tofree: A single CIDR structure which has
                 outlived its usefulness.
          + Returns:
            void
     * cidr_from_inaddr(): Parse a struct in_addr
          + Summary:
            Takes a populated struct in_addr, as you'd get from accept()
            or getaddrinfo() or similar functions. Parses it out and
            generates a CIDR structure based on it. Note that an in_addr
            only contains a host address, so the netmask is initialized
            to all-1's (/32).
          + Arguments:
               o const struct in_addr * uaddr: A populated struct
                 in_addr, from whatever source obtained.
          + Returns:
            CIDR *
            Returns a pointer to a populated CIDR containing the address
            in the passed-in struct in_addr. The netmask is initialized
            to all-1's, and the protocol to IPv4. Use cidr_free() to free
            the structure when you're finished with it. Returns NULL on
            error.
          + Error codes:
               o

                    EFAULT
                            Passed NULL

               o Note:
                 cidr_from_inaddr() can also fail and set errno for any
                 of the reasons listed for cidr_alloc() .
     * cidr_from_in6addr(): Parse a struct in6_addr
          + Summary:
            Takes a populated struct in6_addr, as you'd get from accept()
            or getaddrinfo() or similar functions. Parses it out and
            generates a CIDR structure based on it. Note that a in6_addr
            only contains a host address, so the netmask is initialized
            to all-1's (/128).
          + Arguments:
               o const struct in6_addr * uaddr: A populated struct
                 in6_addr, from whatever source obtained.
          + Returns:
            CIDR *
            Returns a pointer to a populated CIDR containing the address
            in the passed-in struct in6_addr. The netmask is initialized
            to all-1's, and the protocol to IPv6 (though it may contain
            an IPv4-mapped address). Use cidr_free() to free the
            structure when you're finished with it. Returns NULL on
            error.
          + Error codes:
               o

                    EFAULT
                            Passed NULL

               o Note:
                 cidr_from_inaddr() can also fail and set errno for any
                 of the reasons listed for cidr_alloc() .
     * cidr_from_str(): Parse a human-readable string
          + Summary:
            Takes in a netblock description as a human-readable string,
            and creates a CIDR structure from it.
            This is probably the most intricate function in the library.
            It accepts addresses in "address/mask" format. 'address' is
            an IP address in valid written form. For IPv4, it's 1 through
            4 period-separated pieces, expressed in octal, hex, or
            decimal, with the last octet being treated as an 8, 16, 24,
            or 32-bit quantity depending on whether there are 4, 3, 2, or
            1 pieces given (respectively). Of course, you're nuts for
            using that flexibility. For IPv6, it's nice and simple; 8
            colon-separated double-octets, excepting that the last 4
            octets can be expressed as a 4-piece dotted-decimal, like an
            IPv4 address (the full flexibility of the IPv4 parsing engine
            is not available, however; intentionally, though that may
            change if necessary). 'mask' can be either a prefix length
            (/0-/32 for IPv4, /0-/128 for IPv6), or a netmask written in
            the standard form for the address family.
            IPv6 addresses can be specified in fully expanded form, or
            with ::-style contraction. IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses
            (::ffff:a.b.c.d), will be treated as IPv6 addresses. The mask
            can be left off, in which case addresses are treated as host
            addresses (/32 or /128, depending on address family).
            Also, cidr_from_str() will parse DNS PTR-record-style address
            formats. That is, representations like "4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa"
            for IPv4, and an extremely long and annoying form ending in
            .ip6.arpa for IPv6. cidr_from_str() also understands the
            deprecated RFC1886 form of IPv6 PTR records, which ends in
            .ip6.int, though cidr_to_str() will only generate the current
            RFC3152-style .ip6.arpa version. Note also that while
            cidr_to_str() treats all addresses as host addresses when
            building the PTR string (ignoring the netmask),
            cidr_from_str() will fill in the netmask bits as appropriate
            for the string given; any octets (or half-octets, in the IPv6
            form) that are left off the beginning will have their netmask
            bits set to 0.
            It's not the intention of the author that this function
            necessarily be able to decipher any possible address format.
            However, the capabilities given should parse any rational
            address specification, and many irrational ones (like hex/oct
            and collapsed v4 addresses). The intention is rather to
            support the ways the addresses and netmasks are commonly
            written and read, so that a human-readable form can quickly
            be transformed into a format that libcidr can then use in its
            various ways, whether through comparing addresses with
            functions like cidr_contains() , or generating references and
            stats about a netblock with functions like
            cidr_addr_broadcast() and cidr_numhost() , or simply spitting
            it out in different human-readable forms with cidr_to_str() .
          + Arguments:
               o const char * addr: A string containing some
                 human-readable IP block.
          + Returns:
            CIDR *
            Returns a pointer to a populated CIDR describing (hopefully)
            the block you talked about in the string. Use cidr_free() to
            free the structure when you're finished with it. Returns NULL
            on error.
          + Error codes:
               o

                    EFAULT
                            Passed NULL

     * cidr_get_addr(): Return address bits
          + Summary:
            Return the address bits which compose the address. This
            should be used in preference to simply referencing inside the
            CIDR manually in external code, since the structure might
            change on you.
            Generally, if you think you need to call this, you should
            probably rethink what you're doing. Most of the time, one of
            the formatted outputs from cidr_to_str() or one of the
            manipulation functions like cidr_addr_hostmin() is what you
            want. Still, there are times when you're interesting in
            manipulating the address by yourself as a bunch of binary
            bits (the cidrcalc example program does this), so this
            function should be used instead of groping around in the
            structure manually.
          + Arguments:
               o const CIDR * addr: An arbitrary netblock.
          + Returns:
            uint8_t *
            Returns a pointer to an 16-element array of uint8_t's
            representing the address. This array must be free() 'd when
            you're through with it. Returns NULL on error.
          + Error codes:
               o

                    EFAULT
                            Passed NULL

     * cidr_get_mask(): Return netmask bits
          + Summary:
            Return the netmask bits which of the given netblock. This
            should be used in preference to simply referencing inside the
            CIDR manually in external code, since the structure might
            change on you.
            See further notes about the desirability of using this
            function above in the notes for cidr_get_addr() .
          + Arguments:
               o const CIDR * addr: An arbitrary netblock.
          + Returns:
            uint8_t *
            Returns a pointer to an 16-element array of uint8_t's
            representing the netmask. This array must be free() 'd when
            you're through with it. Returns NULL on error.
          + Error codes:
               o

     * cidr_get_pflen(): Network bits in the netmask
          + Summary:
            Poke around the netmask of the passed-in CIDR structure and
            determine how many bits there are in the netmask, as
            appropriate to the address family.
          + Arguments:
               o const CIDR * block: An arbitrary netblock.
          + Returns:
            int
            Returns the number of network bits in the netmask (0-32 for
            IPv4, 0-128 for IPv6). Returns -1 on error.
          + Error codes:

     * cidr_get_proto(): Find a netblock's protocol family
          + Summary:
            Returns the protocol family of an address using one of the
            defined constants. The current choices are CIDR_IPV4 and
            CIDR_IPV6.
          + Arguments:
               o const CIDR * addr: An arbitrary netblock.
          + Returns:
            int
            Returns the address family of the given netblock.

     * cidr_is_v4mapped(): Is address IPv4-mapped IPv6 address?
          + Summary:
            An IPv6 address may be in the network range reserved for
            IPv4-mapped addresses. This function will tell you whether it
            is or not. Note that an IPv4 CIDR is NOT considered an
            IPv4-mapped address, and so will return failure.
          + Arguments:
               o const CIDR * addr: An arbitrary netblock.
          + Returns:
            int
            Returns 0 if the address is an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.
            Returns -1 otherwise.
     * cidr_net_subnets(): Divide a netblock
          + Summary:
            Take in a netblock, and derive the two netblocks which it
            divides up into. Return them in an array.
          + Arguments:
               o const CIDR * addr: The netblock to subdivide.
          + Returns:
            CIDR **
            Returns a 2-element array of CIDR structs, containing the two
            subnets of addr. Each of the elements should be cleaned up
            with cidr_free() , and the array itself then cleaned up with
            free() . Returns NULL on failure.
          + Error codes:

                 cidr_dup() .
     * cidr_net_supernet(): Undivide a netblock
          + Summary:
            Take in a netblock, and derive the parent netblock in which
            it fits.
          + Arguments:
               o const CIDR * addr: The netblock to find the parent of.
          + Returns:
            CIDR *
            Returns a CIDR struct defining the parent network of addr.
            Clean this up with cidr_free() when you're finished with it.
            Returns NULL on failure.
          + Error codes:

          + Summary:
            Determine the total number of addresses in a netblock
            (including the network and broadcast addresses).
            This function returns a pointer to a pre-formatted string
            because we're potentially returning a value up to 2**128. I
            don't feel like trying to portably do 128-bit arithmetic. Do
            you?
          + Arguments:
               o const CIDR * addr: An arbitrary netblock.
          + Returns:
            const char *
            Returns a pointer to a string containing the number of
            addresses in the netblock. Note that this is a static string;
            it should not be overwritten, and doesn't need to be free()
            'd. Make a copy if you want to manipulate it. Returns NULL on
            error.

            Determine the total number of addresses in a netblock with
            the given prefix length (including the network and broadcast
            addresses).
            Note that this takes an IPv6 prefix length; that is, 0-128.
            If you're interested in an IPv4 address with a given prefix
            length, add 96 to it when you call this function.
            See the note in cidr_numaddr() for why we're returning a
            string and not a number.
          + Arguments:

     * cidr_to_inaddr(): Create a struct in_addr
          + Summary:
            Takes in a CIDR and creates a struct in_addr from it. This
            struct can then be used in connect() or similar
            network-related functions. If the users passes in a struct
            in_addr, it will be filled in. Otherwise, one will be
            allocated and returned.
          + Arguments:
               o const CIDR * addr: A CIDR structure describing the host
                 to be translated into a struct in_addr. Note that the
                 netmask is irrelevant and will be ignored.
                 cidr_to_inaddr() supports only IPv4 addresses, as the
                 underlying structure only does.
               o struct in_addr * uptr: A pointer to a pre-allocated
                 struct in_addr, or NULL. If non-NULL, the pointed-at
                 structure will be filled in. If NULL, a new structure
                 will be allocated, filled in, and returned.
          + Returns:
            struct in_addr *
            Returns a pointer to the filled-in struct in_addr. If the
            user passed one in, this will just point to the same place
            and can profitably be ignored. If the user passed in NULL,
            this will point to the struct in_addr we allocated, which
            should be free() 'd by the user when they're finished with
            it. Returns NULL on error.

     * cidr_to_in6addr(): Create a struct in6_addr
          + Summary:
            Takes in a CIDR and creates a struct in6_addr from it. This
            struct can then be used in connect() or similar
            network-related functions. If the users passes in a struct
            in6_addr, it will be filled in. Otherwise, one will be
            allocated and returned.
          + Arguments:
               o const CIDR * addr: A CIDR structure describing the host
                 to be translated into a struct in6_addr. Note that the
                 netmask is irrelevant and will be ignored.
                 cidr_to_in6addr() supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses,
                 as the underlying structure does as well. IPv4 addresses
                 are treated as v4-mapped IPv6 addresses.
               o struct in6_addr * uptr: A pointer to a pre-allocated
                 struct in6_addr, or NULL. If non-NULL, the pointed-at

     * cidr_to_str(): Create a human-readable netblock description
          + Summary:
            Takes in a CIDR structure, and generates up a human-readable
            string describing the netblock. This function has a lot of
            flexibility, depending on the flags passed to it. The default
            output is "address/pflen" form, with the address in a
            reasonably compact form, and the prefix length given
            numerically. Flags alter the output in various ways, and are
            set as bitmasks, so they can be combined however you wish.
            They can be used in any combination that makes sense, and a
            large number of combinations that don't.
            The current flags are:
            CIDR_NOFLAGS: A stand-in for when you just want the default
            output
            CIDR_NOCOMPACT: Don't do ::-style IPv6 compaction
            CIDR_VERBOSE: Show leading 0's in octets [v6 only]
            CIDR_USEV6: Use IPv4-mapped address form for IPv4 addresses
            (::ffff:a.b.c.d)
            CIDR_USEV4COMPAT: Use IPv4-compat form (::a.b.c.d) instead of
            IPv4-mapped form (only meaningful in combination with
            CIDR_USEV6)
            CIDR_NETMASK: Return a netmask in standard form after the
            slash, instead of the prefix length. Note that the form of
            the netmask can thus be altered by the various flags that
            alter how the address is displayed.
            CIDR_ONLYADDR: Show only the address, without the
            prefix/netmask
            CIDR_ONLYPFLEN: Show only the prefix length (or netmask, when
            combined with CIDR_NETMASK), without the address.
            CIDR_WILDCARD: Show a Cisco-style wildcard mask instead of
            the netmask (only meaningful in combination with
            CIDR_NETMASK)
            CIDR_FORCEV6: Forces treating the CIDR as an IPv6 address, no
            matter what it really is. This doesn't do any conversion or
            translation; just treats the raw data as if it were IPv6.
            CIDR_FORCEV4: Forces treating the CIDR as an IPv4 address, no
            matter what it really is. This doesn't do any conversion or
            translation; just treats the raw data as if it were IPv4.
            CIDR_REVERSE: Generates a .in-addr.arpa or .ip6.arpa-style
            PTR record name for the given block. Note that this always
            treats it solely as an address; the netmask is ignored. See
            some notes in cidr_from_str() for details of the asymmetric
            treatment of this form of address representation relating to
            the netmask.
            Many combinations can give somewhat surprising results, but
            they should allow any of a host of manipulations to output
            just the data you might be interested in. The "mkstr" test
            program in the source tree is extremely useful for manual
            testing of the various flags to see visually what they do,
            and is a lot quicker than trying to code them all to test it
            out. Use it to your advantage.
          + Arguments:
               o const CIDR * block: The CIDR structure to generate a
                 string form of. The address family will be autodetected.
               o int flags: A bitmask of the various possible flags the
                 function accepts.
          + Returns:
            char *
            Returns a pointer to a string containing the representation
            of the network. Be sure to free() it when you're finished.
          + Error codes:
               o

                    EINVAL
                            Invalid argument (bad block or flags)

               o

                    ENOENT
                            Internal error (shouldn't happen)

               o

                    ENOMEM
                            malloc() failed

               o Note:
                 cidr_to_str() can also fail and set errno for any of the
                 reasons listed for cidr_alloc() or cidr_get_pflen() .
     * cidr_version(): Library version
          + Summary:
            Returns a static string describing the library release
            version.
          + Arguments:
               o None
          + Returns:
            const char *
            Returns a pointer to a static string describing the library
            version number. It shouldn't be overwritten or free() 'd.
